title: Customers And Use Cases
---

Understanding who our customers are, and what their needs and use cases are, is fundamental to finding product-market fit. We have identified 4 primary user personas that have distinct needs and have optimized the system to meet their requirements.

## Project Launchers - Seeking Capital

The whole reason to build a Leveraged DEX is to enable those without large capital to access institutional scale capital. These users' activity is the core business value that is being created.

## Capital Providers - Seeking Passive Returns

From individuals to institutions, our platform is built with insurance for safe returns. X7 Finance’s architecture does not allow for over-capitalization or an under-reserve.

## System Governors - Seeking Leadership

X7 Finance provides a limitless opportunity for market participants to bring positive change within the ecosystem with on-chain governance.

## Traders - Seeking Active Returns

All tradable pairs are designed to influence price appreciation between each moving part of the ecosystem. The X7 Finance ecosystem tokens’ built-in synergetic mechanisms feed each token’s trading market and provide limitless arbitrage opportunities and advanced trading strategies.
