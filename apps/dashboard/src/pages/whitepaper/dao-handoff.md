title: DAO Handoff
---

Once the above has been completed we expect that we will be able to turn over a large portion of the ecosystem to DAO governance.

Until we are fully confident in each component’s proper operation the X7 development team will retain some ability to provide emergency remedial actions. These kinds of retained privileges will not extend to custodial services of funds or liquidity, but to overall system operation and settings.

As the DAO handoff occurs, and DAO participants self-organize to maximize their profitability, we expect an increasingly rapid turnover of control until the only special control the X7 development team has is through the Magister NFTs. And so too, that level of control will diminish over time.
