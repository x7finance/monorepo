gm or gn.

A few critical validation tests of the swap feature failed and we need another shift to ensure proper function. We feel this is critical to ensure swaps are optimal and meet the user specification.

As two pioneers originated loans with an expectation the swap would go live on June 2nd we will offer a small refund to the origination fee on loan 8 and we will pay the first liability payment on loan 7.

We only expect this delay to be 12-18 hours.

Thank you for your continued support!
