There has been some final coordination and integration work going on all day. We expect to deploy the loan origination UI within an hour or two, the swap UI a few hours after that, and the loan repayment UI over the next day or two. We will provide directions to the current borrowers for how to pay their liabilities prior to the repayment UI being live.

Due to some technical difficulties, Binance Smart Chain will take another day or so to enable on the user interface.

We great appreciate your support and enthusiasm today!

Long Live DeFi!
