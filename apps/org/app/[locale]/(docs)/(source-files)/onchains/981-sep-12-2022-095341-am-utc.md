You may have noticed we have begun funding deployer wallets.

In the next 24 hours we will be deploying the following contracts:

    X7DAO ERC-20 Token\
    X7R ERC-20 Token\
    X7101 ERC-20 Token\
    X7102 ERC-20 Token\
    X7103 ERC-20 Token\
    X7104 ERC-20 Token\
    X7105 ERC-20 Token

    X7R Liquidity Hub\
    X7DAO Liquidity Hub\
    X710 series Liquidity Hub

    X7 Token Time Lock (for time-locking liquidity provider tokens)

After these have been deployed and verified we will soon after deploy:

    Token Migration Contracts
    Discount Utility NFT
    Governance NFT

We will launch each contract with ample time for it to be reviewed before it goes live.

After we publish the whitepaper and go live with the website, we will be creating a community multi-signature wallet for marketing and community operations.

We nominate the following individuals (tg) but invite the community to participate in finalizing this list.

    https://t.me/CallMeLandlord\
    https://t.me/Zaratustra\
    https://t.me/robthebank44\
    https://t.me/gazuga\
    https://t.me/KBCrypto11

The DAO will ultimately decide whether to continue to fund this particular multi-signature wallet.

Thank you for all of your support.

Trust no one. Trust code. Long live DeFi.
