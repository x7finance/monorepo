GM or GN!

Everything is looking GREEN for the migration to proceed on schedule.

1. The team is currently confirming all new v1 token purchases since the wallet snapshot are known to the migration contract. We will make our best effort to ensure any new addresses are added prior to the migration. No v1 token holder will be left behind.

2. The NFT whitelist will be deactivated just prior to the migration, and all NFTs will be available for sale to the public.

We want to thank the community for the incredible support. Due to the overwhelmingly high participation rate in the migration we will be able to recover the vast majority of v1 liquidity. This is a truly amazing feat and a testament to the commitment of the community to drive this project to massive success.
