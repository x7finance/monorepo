Another milestone has been accomplished today, Xchange now supports multiple chains on beta.x7.finance!

Fund permissionless finance by minting aX7D on Arbitrum, mX7D on Polygon, and oX7D on Optimism.
All X7D is ALWAYS backed 1:1 with the native currency of the chain.

1 aX7D == 1 ETH\
1 mX7D == 1 MATIC\
1 oX7D == 1 ETH

Early minters will be eligible for additional benefits prior to the launch of the X7D staked yield-bearing NFT contracts.

Use our optimized decentralized Swap UI to trade pairs on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism.

This update also comes with several quality-of-life improvements. We look forward to you discovering them. After the community feedback and testing are completed and we will be deploying this beta release candidate to production!

Long Live DeFi.
