_As Helmuth von Moltke_

In a DeFi world filled with meme tokens, larps, and “speculative” projects, X7 was stealth launched to bootstrap a community and be a test bed for the technology and ideas that the teams have been thinking about and working on in the background. Overwhelmingly positive community reception for the project and the hunger of the community for our product has accelerated our timetables. As the full ecosystem comes to fruition it should be known that these ideas have been refined and improved upon by the community's amazing outpouring of ideas and behaviors. We thank everyone, members of the community, we are building this for you!
