X7 is an ecosystem of innovative smart contracts that provide those with visionary ideas access to leveraged seed capital without lenders incurring the risk of losing the principal.

At the heart of X7 is a peer-to-peer Automated Market Making (AMM) Decentralized Exchange (DEX) integrated with a novel trustless, permissionless on-chain undercollateralized loan origination and servicing system known as the Lending Pool. Functioning similar to a bank, the Lending Pool takes deposits, converts them to loanable assets, manages the lifecycle of a loan issued to X7â€™s DEX, and distributes the loan profits to the ecosystem.

This product white paper will lay out the core components and utility that each part provides and explain the ecosystem.
