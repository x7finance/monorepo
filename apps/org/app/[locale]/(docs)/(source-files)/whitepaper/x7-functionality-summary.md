Below follows a quick high-level summary of each component of the system and its role in the system.

## Xchange

- Add Initial Liquidity to any ETH-based pair with our permissionless, trustless Initial Liquidity Loan (ILL) functionality, increasing liquidity and market capitalization.
- First among peers, X7’s DEX’s front-end dApp will connect and function with all top Uniswap Interface-compliant DEX’s.

## Initial Liquidity Loan

- Defined loan term created in a permissionless, trustless fashion to be funded and originated by the Lending Pool.

## Lending Pool

- Manage loan terms availability, respond to loan origination requests, and balance reserves ratios.
- Manages deposits through a permissionless, trustless fully collateralized mintable deposit token, with a 1-to-1 face value of ETH, that can be staked for a share of the profits.

## Constellation Token

- Collateralized reserves for Lending Pool’s X7 Deposit tokens, with the functionality to accumulate token value and act as lender of last resort against X7Deposit token issuance.

## Decentralized Anonymous Organization
