### Do I need to complete any forms to take a loan?

No. Anyone, at any time, can deploy their project tokens using an ILL once there are funds in the lending pool.

### What happens when a initial liquidity loan (ILL) is taken?

When an ILL is taken, you will select the loan type and amount of ETH you wish to deploy your tokens into the liquidity pair with.

Each one of these will have a fixed leverage type against them which can be found on the [loan page here](/loans/)

When the transaction is processed, the loan funds are automatically placed into the liquidity pair, and you will receive the LP tokens for this pair.

### What happens if I donâ€™t pay the loan?

You will default on the loan, and the ETH will be removed from the liquidity pair.

The liquidity pair will still function and be tradeable at all times, even if you default on the loan.

### Is there a fee for taking a loan?

Yes, there is an originator fee that goes back into the ecosystem to support the health of the X7 ecosystem.

### What happens if no funds are in the lending pool and I want to deploy using a loan?

In this case, when you request a loan, an NFT will be minted with a fee in line with your loan. An outside investor can then purchase this NFT, with the funds raised in this purchased being used to fund your pair.
