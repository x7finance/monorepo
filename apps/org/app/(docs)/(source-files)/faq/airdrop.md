### When will the airdrop happen?

You will have fair warning in the form of a non-extended timelock and the setting and freezing of the destination from these contracts into an airdropper/launch contract. The timelock + frozen destination mechanism will ensure that investors and researchers have ample time to evaluate the plan and determine their strategy.
