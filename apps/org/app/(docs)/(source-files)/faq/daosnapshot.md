### Why is X7 Finance using it?

X7 Finance when handed control of the DAO will utilize its own custom built DAO dApp. Until then proposers can issue advisory votes via snaphot.org. With this being said proposers should consider that until full hand over of DAO capabilities, changes to the ecosystem will be limited and proposals should be community based rather than code based.
