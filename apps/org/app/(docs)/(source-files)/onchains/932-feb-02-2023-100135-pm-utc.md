We were about to have our first liquidation, for Loan ID 4.

I was able to estimate gas to run the transaction. And it failed:

Instead, an MEV bot ran the transaction for us:

This isn't JUST a liquidation (that returned the funds to the pool from the pair for non-payment).

This is an anonymous bot competing for the opportunity to collect the escrowed liquidation reward on behalf of the X7 Ecosystem.

Loan ID 2 and Loan ID 3 are still in repayment and we will see them fully paid to demonstrate the successful origination and repayment of each of the current loan terms.

Loan ID 5 will be used to demonstrate liquidation with high gas on transfer and balance checks as well as transfer locks (all honeypotting techniques).

We have a few more example tokens to run and will publish all of the relevant transactions to trace the loan lifecycles for each of them.

We have begun to work through third party integrations with Xchange with the unverified factory and pair contract.

We can confirm that Bobby Buy Bot and Buy Bot Tech will both support Xchange swaps in the very near future.
