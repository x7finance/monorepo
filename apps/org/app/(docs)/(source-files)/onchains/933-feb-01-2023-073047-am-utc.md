We are completing some final automation and assesement on the deployment.

So far so good.

There is some additional configuration that needs to occur on the unverified Xchange Factory contract and then we will begin with some demonstration transactions.

As part of the demonstration approximately 5 ETH will be transferred from the Lending Pool Reserve contract to the Lending Pool contract to faciliate the demonstration loans.

The demonstration will run over the next couple of days to allow for one or more of the test loans to default and be liquidated (only after it is in default).

Thank you for coming along for the ride!
