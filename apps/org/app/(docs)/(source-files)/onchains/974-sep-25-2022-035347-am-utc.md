The migration contract is going to go live promptly at 4:00 am utc time.

Timeline:

9/25 4:00 am utc - Migration contract goes live. Visit x7.finance to use the dAPP.

9/26 4:00 am utc - NFT sale goes live. Any wallet that has migrated at least a combined 1000 tokens (any combination of tokens is acceptable) will be on the whitelist.

9/27 4:00 am utc - A snapshot of wallets that hold each X7 v1 token will be uploaded to the contract. For the sake of investor safety we ask that you verify that list. After this point new wallets that are not known to the migration contract are not guarenteed to be able to migrate new purchased tokens. See the verified migration contract for full details.

9/28 4:00 am utc - The migration process begins per the predefined, deterministic process. There are at least 14 individual transactons that must be run to accomplish the migration and airdrop.

The sun rises on the X7 v2 ecosystem, ready to meet the demands of a world class DEX, lending protocol, and DAO.
