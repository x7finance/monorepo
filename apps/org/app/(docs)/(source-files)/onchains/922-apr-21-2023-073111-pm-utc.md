Congratulations on the journey towards DAO governance.

While much of the X7 DAO's influence will be in the form of on chain smart contract control, from time to time it may be reasonable and beneficial to issue advisory votes. These kinds of votes could be ways to record sentiment towards particular decision makers or ongoing activities that, if not heeded, could lead to further consequences or changes.

The X7 developers choose to recognize the recent vote (ipfs://bafkreiap6sbw6rk6lmfu2tmiszibftxpi3tc7kwyxzt76tuclw4znlvofm) as an advisory vote and further choose to endorse the directives therein.

We wholeheartedly agree that the project has evolved to a point where greater communication, clarity, and consistency is necessary for success.

For coordination and organizational reasons the X7 Developers will provide weekly updates starting on Monday, 2023-04-24 and every 7 days thereafter.

We look forward to this next chapter of our shared journey.

Long live DeFi!
