gm or gn.

The swap will go live on time as indicated.

We want to take this time to remind everyone about some beta details.

The beta allows for selection of a particular DEX implementation to trade on.

On the swap page you will find a selector prominently located at the top of the page. This selector now defaults to Xchange. However, selecting Uniswap (or in the near future Pancake Swap or Sushi Swap) will enable routing on pairs for that particular dex.

Before we have full cross dex ROUTING enabled we encourage you to trade with ETH as the base currency for swaps as multi pair swaps across stablecoins are not likely to result in effective or valid paths.

We also would like to again caution that tokens launched on Xchange should be evaluated with the same level of scrutiny as any other token launch and no X7 Dev will endorse one or another token on Xchange.

Happy swapping! Welcome to the beginning of the beginning.

Trust no one. Trust code. Long Live DeFi baby!
