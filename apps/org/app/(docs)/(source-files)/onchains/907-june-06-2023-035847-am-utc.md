gm or gn.

We had a fantastic beta launch.

The purpose of the beta is to get the product in real people's hands. Have them go through our user experience. Have their token contracts interact with the ecosystem contracts. The feedback we receive now is invaluable.

We will continue with workstream updates next week.

Right now our sole focus is listening to feedback and rapidly improving the Xchange user experience.

We want to thank the entire community for making the beta launch as successful as possible. As we mentioned in our last on chain message, we are really at the beginning of the beginning. And you are here with us.

Long live DeFi!
