gm or gn.

We are aware of the site warnings some browsers are displaying.

We are doing what we can to determine the cause and/or rectify the issue.

Additionally we will be serving the app on a number of back up domains (which will be published on the blockchain for proof of validity).

When Xchange goes live we will be open sourcing the site source code on Github as well as hosting the live site on IPFS.

We apologize for any inconvenience. This only emphasizes the importance of decentralization.

The more success we see, the more of these kinds of malicious attacks we may see. X7 is providing a decentralized capability that not only is going to compete with many existing successful DeFi products, but also powerful entities in the TradFi/CeFi world.

Trust no one. Trust code. Long live DeFi!
