With the global crypto revelations around centralized borrowing and lending coming to a head today, the benefit of the trustless decentralized financial paradigm is showing its importance.

Xchange's initial liquidity loan facility will provide access to capital by making a market through a modified UniswapV2 style Automated Market Maker.

At no time will the lending pool (and by extension the X7D depositors) be exposed to any counterparty risk whatsoever.

X7 will be providing a set of financial guarantees that not even some of the most public CeFi and TradFi businesses can offer.

Trust code. Long live DeFi!
