Please find below a workstream progress update for 2023-05-08:

We continued to make progress on the Omni routing library code, the lending UI, and the marketing pitch deck. We have also made additional progress on the borrowing workflows and we expect that progress to speed up in the near future.

Please take a look at https://beta.x7.finance (we know it flags as phishing in some browsers and we are working through that) for th X7D deposit and withdrawal page ("Fund" in the top bar). We are working through a couple of UI issues with non-ethereum mainnet chains and we will ship those to the beta site as soon as we can.
