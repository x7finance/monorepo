Congratulations to the first creation of an Xchange pair on the Binance Smart Chain.

We want to reiterate that the X7 Dev team will not endorse any particular token or launch on Xchange.

Xchange is a permissionless swap protocol. We encourage DeFi participants to exercise the same level of caution they always should when evaluating a swap opportunity.

Trust no one. Trust code. Long Live DeFi!
