Quick Progress Update:

The Xchange multi-dex swap support is nearing completion.

The Uniswap interface is designed to support one UniswapV2 and one UniswapV3 implementation on any particular chain.

The Xchange interface will support uniswapV2 (which includes the Xchange protocol) and uniswapV3 implementations for any number of implementations on a given chain.

We are targeting the following on all supported chains for launch:

    Xchange (UniswapV2)\
    Uniswap (UniswapV2 & Uniswap V3)\
    Pancakeswap (UniswapV2)\
    Sushiswap (UniswapV2)

However on April 1, 2023, the UniswapV3 protocol will be licensed for free use and we expect that numerous non-Uniswap implementations will be deployed across various blockchains, including the BNB smartchain, but to include many others.

X7 will be ready to support whichever UniswapV3 implementations are prominant on a given blockchain, as well as fill the gap and deploy the UniswapV3 protocol on blockchains where it is absent (such as the BNB smartchain).

We again thank you for your patience and assure you that Xchange will become THE one stop shop for dex support not only across the five pre-announced chains, but also across any new up and coming EVM chain.

Long Live DeFi!
