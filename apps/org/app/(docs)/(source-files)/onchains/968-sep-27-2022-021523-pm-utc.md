The community multisig-wallet has been configured.

All signers have been funded 0.2 ETH for signing costs.

A final multisig change is queued to remove 0x7000a09c425ABf5173FF458dF1370C25d1C58105 as a signer.

Once approved and executed by two multisig signers, this multisig wallet will be controlled solely by the ratified community members.
