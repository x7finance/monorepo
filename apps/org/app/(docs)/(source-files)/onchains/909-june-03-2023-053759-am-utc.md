gm or gn!

We apologize for the technical delay for the beta release of the swap UI. The critical user journeys through the swap UI have passed our validation testing and we are ready to deploy.

Due to the imminent project launches from within the community that are dependent on the beta swap UI - that will be immediate users of it - we have decided to schedule a precise time for the release of the swap user interface so that those projects can be given some time to prepare for their respective launches.

The swap UI will go live at:

2023-06-04 14:00 UTC

We want to emphasize that this is a beta launch. The purpose of the beta period is to gather user feedback and ensure that the product is flawless and delightful for our general availability release.

Trust no one. Trust code. Long live DeFi!
