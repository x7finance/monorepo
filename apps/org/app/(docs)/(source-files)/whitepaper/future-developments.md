title: Future Developments

The X7 ecosystem provides mechanisms not only for individual investors and lenders to profit from the ecosystem activities but also for the flow of capital into the hands of the DAO (and its delegates).

Our expectation is that these funds will at first be focused on marketing and business development activities, but then in the future will fund other kinds of project needs, such as additional features and components to the blockchain ecosystem and the user interface.

We would find it plausible that the DAO could choose to contract out the development of novel loan term contracts or whole new sources of revenue for the project (which could in turn contribute to the ecosystem splitter).

Below is a non-exhaustive list of possible future developments.

- Launch accessory services
  - Token and Initial Liquidity Lockers
  - Launchpad services
  - Trustless consensus-driven code audit services
- Advanced Trading
  - Leveraged trading capabilities, building on learned experience from leveraged initial liquidity and capital-protecting liquidity pairs
  - Wrapped assets to expose the holder to various levels of profit exposure within the X7 ecosystem
- Liquidity pairs with configurable or alternative automated marketing making capabilities
- Non-native token (ETH, BNB, etc.) initial liquidity loans
