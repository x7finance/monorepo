Over the last few years there have been plenty of examples of NFTs selling jpegs. But NFTs within the X7 ecosystem will be pure utility.

## Non-Fungible Mint Pricing and Capability

The mint price and NFT capabilities may be controlled by the DAO to ensure that any benefits are net-neutral or net-positive to the X7 ecosystem.

## Tokenized Discounts and Benefits

Within the X7 ecosystem, various parts of the system incur fees. LP trading fees on the decentralized exchange, loan origination fees, loan interest, and token swap fees. Providing a limited set of NFTs that provide discounts and other benefits will enable power users and community members to significantly reduce their cost of use and encourage adoption.

There are four flavors with different benefits, outlined below.

| Kind           | Benefits                                                                          | Maximum Mints | Initial Mint Price |

## Pioneer Commemorative NFT

Any wallet address that migrated at least 1000 v1 tokens (the sum of any combination) will be able to mint a Pioneer NFT. The Pioneer NFT will have unique generative art as a commemorative item. The Pioneer NFT will also grant the holder a perpetual right to periodically draw native token rewards from a reward pool funded by the treasury splitter, giving it intrinsic future value in the form of redeemable rewards.

## Magister NFT

Each Magister token will cost 50 ETH to mint, and that ETH will go directly into token liquidity across the ecosystem. The Magister token also offers discounts on dex trading and loan origination.
