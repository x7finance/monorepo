title: Roadmap
tags: [whitepaper]
---

At the time of publishing of this whitepaper a significant portion of the above described ecosystem has already been built and tested, however it is critical to note that software systems are best released incrementally so as to ensure each component works properly “in the wild” before considering it released and “locking it in place”. The following represents the current (as of this version of the whitepaper) roadmap. These should be considered more like milestones than a calendar of events. As each is accomplished we know we are one step closer to general release of the ecosystem into the global wild.

- Pioneer NFT & Reward Pool implementation
- Xchange and Leveraged Initial Liquidity Capability
- Lending dApp
- X7D Minting
- X7D Staking NFTs
- X7D Dashboard dApp
- DAO Governance Contracts
- DAO Governance dApp

In addition to the above development milestones, the following additional deliveries can be expected:

## Marketing Materials:

- Investor deck/summary
- Prettified ecosystem diagrams and explanations

## Development Tooling and Documentation:

- Technical design document for all smart contracts
- Smart contract trust diagram
- Technical User Guide for DAO interactions
- Integration Guide for third party integrations
- Open sourced SDKs for smart contract interactions
- Open sourced testing and development tooling
