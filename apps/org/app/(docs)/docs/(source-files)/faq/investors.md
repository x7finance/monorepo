### What is $X7D?

The $X7D token is a proof of ownership token of how much funds you have deposited to the lending pool.

For example, if you deposit 1 ETH to the lending pool, you will receive 1 $X7D token.

### What if I hold $X7D and there is no funds in the lending pool?

If you want to convert your $X7D to ETH you can do this anytime, even if there are no funds in the lending pool.

If this happens, your ETH will be withdrawn from the constellation tokens; these ensure there are always enough funds in the ecosystem.

### Can I make a profit on my $X7D tokens?

Yes, you can; you will be able to wrap your $X7D into an NFT that increases in value depending on when you create the NFT and the floor price of the constellation tokens when you unwrap the NFT.

### What is Loan lending NFT?

When a project makes a request for a loan and there are insufficient funds in the lending pool an NFT will be minted with a fee in line with the projects loan amount.

An outside investor can then purchase this NFT, and the funds will be used for the project's liquidity pair loan.
