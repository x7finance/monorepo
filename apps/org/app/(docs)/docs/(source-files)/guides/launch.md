## Launch on Xchange

As a project dev, choosing the right DEX to launch your token is a critical decision. [Xchange](https://beta.x7.finance/#/swap), the native Decentralized Exchange (DEX) of X7 Finance, offers a range of benefits that can help ensure the success of your token launch. Here's why you should consider launching your token on [Xchange](https://beta.x7.finance/#/swap):

## Lower Launch Costs

Our unique Initial Liquidity Loans provide a mechanism to add initial liquidity to an Automated Market Making (AMM) trading pair with borrowed capital. This reduces the amount of capital locked to a pair, allowing you to launch your project with less capital while still ensuring high liquidity.

## High Liquidity

High liquidity is crucial for the success of any token launch. [Xchange](https://beta.x7.finance/#/swap) ensures high liquidity for your token through our unique lending solutions. This means your token holders can execute large trades without significantly impacting the price.

## Say Goodbye to Lost Launch Liquidity

With X7 Finance's innovative Initial Liquidity Loans (ILLs), the issue of lost launch liquidity is a thing of the past. These loans are **under** collateralized, enabling the protocol to support institutional-sized liquidity at a fraction of the cost.

When the loan term ends and the principal is due, project developers have two options:

a.) Pay off the loan: This results in complete ownership of the loaned capital by the project developer

b.) Default on the loan: In this case, the lent principal is returned back to the pool. The project developer retains ownership of the rest of the liquidity pool, and trading remains available throughout the entire process.

We believe option b will be particularly appealing to the market for several reasons:

- Project developers gain access to exceptional launch liquidity.
- The cost to the developers is minimal or even non-existent.
- The system of smart contracts ensures protection for all parties involved.

With Xchange, you can launch your project with confidence, knowing that you have the liquidity you need and the security you deserve.
