Please find below a non-exhaustive list of work streams that the X7 Developer team is working on, as well as an approximate completion %.

There is famous aphorism in software engineering:

    The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.

    - Tom Cargill, Bell Labs

We ask that you understand that software engineering is just as much art as science and that at our core we share the same enthusiasm (and financial incentive) to drive this project to release and beyond.

Each work stream has a concrete deliverable that in almost all cases will materialize as a new user interface, document, artifact, released source code, or deployed smart contract. Once this deliverable has been delivered we will cease reporting its status.

While these work streams are being worked on in parallel, we are focusing on them in such a way as to enable a fully live product as the highest priority.

We will title each work stream with an identifier (WS1, WS2, etc.) to aid in discussion.

We would also like to remind everyone that as soon as we can, we will deploy beta features to [https://beta.x7.finance](https://beta.x7.finance) to receive fast feedback before going live at [https://app.x7.finance](https://app.x7.finance).

As always,

Trust no one. Trust Code.
