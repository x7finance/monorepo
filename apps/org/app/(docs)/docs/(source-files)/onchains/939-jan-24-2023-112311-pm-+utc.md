gm or gn.

We are gearing up for many of our final deployments.

We heard the enthusiasm about external lending pools and wanted to shed some light on how those will work, and why we think they will be so valuable to the X7 Ecosystem.

Below find the interface for getting a quote and originating a loan:

```js
interface IX7LendingPool {

    function getQuote(
        // This is the borrower for the purposes of calculating discounts
        // When the loan is originated, it will be msg.sender
        address borrower,

        // This is the address to the loan term NFT contract
        // It determines the terms of the loan, such as the origination fee,
        // premium periods, payback periods, etc.
        IX7InitialLiquidityLoanTerm loanTerm,

        // This is the desired loan amount.
        // It will be returned as a rounded amount
        // to the nearest GWEI.
        // There will be a discount that scales linearly
        // with this amount. The more that is borrowed,
        // the larger the discount.
        uint256 loanAmount,

        // This is the desired loan duration.
        // There will be a discount that scales inversely
        // so that the shorter the loan, the large the
        // discount that is applied.
        uint256 loanDurationSeconds


        // This returns an array of values:
        //      roundedLoanAmount
        //      originationFee
        //      totalPremium
        //      premiumFeeModifier
        //      originationFeeModifier
        //
        // These values are then used to fill in the required fields
        // for getting an initial liquidity loan. They also allow for
        // end user interfaces to display the discount that will be applied
        // by the protocol.

    ) external view returns (uint256[5] memory);


    function getInitialLiquidityLoan(
        // The token to be paired with WETH in the liquidity pair
        address tokenAddress,

        // The amount of the token to add to the liquidity pair
        uint256 amount,

        // The loanTerm contract that was used to generate the quote
        IX7InitialLiquidityLoanTerm loanTerm,

        // The rounded loan amount from the quote
        uint256 loanAmount,

        // The duration that was used in the quote
        uint256 loanDurationSeconds,

        // The address to receive the pair LP tokens
        address liquidityReceiver,

        // The deadline for the transaction, similar to what would be in
        // the uniswapV2Router addLiquidityETH
        uint256 deadline

        // Additionally the borrower must send in the correct amount of ETH
        // to originate the loan as well as an escrowed liquidation fee (that
        // will be returned to the borrower when the loan liability is satisfied)
    ) external payable returns (uint256 loanID);

}
```

The implementation of getInitialLiquidityLoan allows for two "modes".

In one mode, the call includes ONLY the origination fee and liquidation escrow ETH value. In this mode, the capital for the loan will be provided by the lending pool (and the transaction will fail if the lending pool does not have sufficient capital).

However, in the second mode, the call includes ETH for not only the origination fee and liquidation escrow, but also for the lent capital itself. All payments for this loan will be split between the X7 decentralized system and the caller (external lender).

What is the market effect of this?

The external lending pools are now able to compete amongst each other offering discounts above and beyond the discounts that the X7 ecosystem provides by "taking it out of their end". Additionally, ownership of a Borrowing MAXI NFT will be absolutely essential to remain competitive.

X7 will always have a decentralized lending pool but it may end up being a "lender of last resort" while third parties create centralized, semi-decentralized, or fully decentralized lending pools to take advantage of the safety guarantees within Xchange's liquidity pair to secure the borrowed capital. X7 will be the stable, decentralized platform upon which all pseudo-under-collateralized initial liquidity lending can occur.

We are as excited as you are to see the remaining contracts deployed on a public blockchain and the X7 machine begin to hum with activity.

Trust the code! Long Live DeFi!
