## What are the constellation tokens?

The constellation tokens are a series of tokens that can be traded between each other as they share liquidity pairs with each other.

They act as a backstop to the lending pool to make sure there is always enough funds in the ecosystem so loan investors can retrieve their loan whenever they like

### What is the tax on the constellation tokens?

The current tax is 2%. It can be found by dividing the feeNumerator / feeDenominator.

feeNumerator = 200
feeDenominator = 10000

=> 200/10000 = 0.02

100% is equal to 1 => 0.02 \* 100 = 2%

### How do the constellation tokens affect the X7D interest rates?

The X7D will get wrapped into an NFT that has the constellation tokens floor price at the time of mint in its metadata

When you unwrap the NFT it compares the difference between the current floor price of the constellation tokens with the past price in the metadata

This difference will be calculated as the reward

### If the lending pool is empty, is the constellation liquidity used for new loans?

No, if the lending pool is empty and a project is looking for a loan to deploy its liquidity pair an NFT is minted.

An outside investor can purchase this NFT, and these funds are used for the liquidity pair loan.

### What is arbitrage?

Arbitrage trading is the practice of buying and selling the same asset on different liquidity pairs to take advantage of price differences.

In the context of two tokens, it involves buying one token on one exchange where the price is lower and selling it on another exchange where the price is higher to make a profit from the price difference.

For example, say that Token A is trading for $10 on Exchange X, while on Exchange Y, it is trading for $12. An arbitrage trader would buy Token A on Exchange X for $10 and sell it on Exchange Y for $12, making a profit of $2 per Token A. This type of trading requires fast execution and can be facilitated by automated trading algorithms.

Overall, arbitrage trading helps to bring the prices of the same asset into alignment across different markets, as traders exploit the price differences until they disappear.

### Do I need to have an arbitrage bot to invest in them?

No, the arbitrage part of the constellation tokens is only designed for traders or bots who want to take advantage of the price difference between them.

You can simply buy, hold and trade these tokens.
