In order to attract as many interested parties into the ecosystem and ensure that the number of people that can benefit from this decentralized system is maximized, a deflationary “benefit” or “reward” token will exist that will receive buybacks, burns, and liquidity additions.

This token will be most interesting to retail investors that want to be exposed to the overall upside without significant effort on their part.

At the start, this token will have a token fee associated with trading it, but it is expected that the DAO will lower that fee to

zero once there is less need for ad-hoc manual capital injection.

This token is expected to eventually be traded on every major centralized exchange.
