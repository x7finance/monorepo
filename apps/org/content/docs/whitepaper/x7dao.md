An ERC20 governance token which allows holders to vote on fee rates, loan terms, funding terms, tradable token tax terms, distribution of capital flows and any additional settings on and off chain. This includes the establishment of committees and other foundational efforts off chain.

There is a complex interplay between the various tokens and contracts within the X7 ecosystem. While the X7 development team will seed these contracts with reasonable percentages, rates, terms, etc. the optimal values are not known apriori.

Holders of **X7DAO** tokens will be able to participate in proposals to modify various settings across the ecosystem.

A portion of lending and DEX revenue

will flow into the **X7DAO** liquidity pair as buybacks and liquidity additions as well as direct rewards to **X7DAO** voters.

See the Governance section below for more details on the DAO governance system.
