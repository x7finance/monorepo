title: X7 ecosystem token Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP)
tags: [whitepaper]
---

The original stealth launched tokens had their liquidity tokens sent to the burn wallet. This was to instill confidence in investors of a stealth launch that there was no intention or ability to withdraw the capital in the liquidity pairs.

While the X7 ecosystem of smart contracts is being built with the flexibility and resilience to last, it is possible that eventually a systemic upgrade will need to take place. All X7 ecosystem

tokens LP tokens (initial + auto liquidity) are being locked in a time-lock contract. The default destination for this LP will be the burn wallet and the starting lock time will be 2 years. The DAO will be able to perform any of the following actions on the time lock contract:

1. Extend the time lock
2. Change the receiver

When the time lock expires, the receiver address will be able to withdraw any of the tokens in any amount. This will allow trustless, contract driven migrations from the old tokens to new uses for that LP. If no action is taken the LP will remain locked as no transactions will ever be received from the dead address.
