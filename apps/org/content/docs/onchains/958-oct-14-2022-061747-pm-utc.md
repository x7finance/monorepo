We are happy to see the positive reception of the whitepaper and we hope it fills in a number of gaps in terms of the short and medium term project vision.

We encourage and are grateful for all feedback, both trivial and in terms of the content and vision.

We will be producing iterative versions of the whitepaper to incorporate this feedback.

The march towards DAO governance begins now, as the community self-organizes to provide this feedback.

Please also direct your attention to the bottom of the roadmap, as these items will be delivered incrementally along with the milestones that have been published.
