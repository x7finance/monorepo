The time has come to enable the community multisig.

At the earliest convenience can the community leaders make a post on TG or Twitter with:

1. A list of wallets to be used as signers on the multi-signature gnosis safe
2. Each individual signer confirming the accuracy of the list

Once this is done, the signers will be added and full control of the multi-signature gnosis safe will be handed over to that group.

We will transfer 0.2 ETH to each wallet for transaction execution expenses, so the signing wallets may be unfunded initially.

In addition to the relevant portion of the NFT sale proceeds, we expect to add to the community wallet significantly post migration, above and beyond the coded allocation on the Treasury profit splitter.
