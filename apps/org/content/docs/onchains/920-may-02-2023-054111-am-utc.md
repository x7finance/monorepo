We also want to let the community know we are working through the issues with the pioneer NFT opensea listings. If we cannot find resolution soon, we will advise the community to use a different NFT marketplace. Additionally we think on our medium term roadmap we will include a native X7 NFT marketplace. The last thing that is needed is Yet Another NFT Marketplace, however it is critical for the community and the ecosystem that X7 NFTs remain as liquid as possible. We would also welcome any community member to provide a suitbly decentralized X7 NFT marketplace (permissionless on chain marketplace and open source UI) and we will be happy to endorse it.

As always,

Trust no one. Trust Code.
