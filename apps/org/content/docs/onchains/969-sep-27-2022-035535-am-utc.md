The snapshot will occur via off-chain data sources on a random block after 4am utc.

This snapshot will be entered into the contracts within 1 hour.

This snapshot transaction will include any current holder (wallet) that has tokens outstanding. Any wallet that has already migrated or migrates their tokens prior to our balance snapshot and liquidity harvesting will also be included in the migration to v2.

At any time you may confirm that a wallet is included in the migration by calling the read function isAv1TokenHolder(tokenAddress, holderAddress).
