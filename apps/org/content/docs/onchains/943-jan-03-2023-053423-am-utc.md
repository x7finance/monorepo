Xchange rate limit issue on 2023-01-02

-

At approximately 930 utc, Xchange stopped being able to fetch pricing data. This was detected by the community and development team.

The root cause was determined to be a rate limit with a node provider. We took immediate action by increasing the node api limits and behavior returned to operational.

Remedial actions and preventive actions include looking at support for multiple providers (potentially run by the community) and a "Bring your own provider" solution. In addition, multiple monitoring services have been set up to smoke test the production app.

We apologize for any service disruption and are committed to keeping a 99.99% uptime.
