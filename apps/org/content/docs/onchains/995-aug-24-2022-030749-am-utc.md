Liquidity will be added and trading will go live approximately one hour from now at:

        04:00 am utc

ETH pairs will be created for each of the following tokens:

    X7001   0x7001629B8BF9A5D5F204B6d464a06f506fBFA105\
    X7002   0x70021e5edA64e68F035356Ea3DCe14ef87B6F105\
    X7003   0x70036Ddf2F2850f6d1B9D78D652776A0d1caB105\
    X7004   0x70041dB5aCDf2F8aa648A000FA4A87067AbAE105\
    X7005   0x7005D9011F4275747D5cb38bC3deB0C46EdbD105

This will be initiated by a single transaction on the X7 Liquidity Hub (0x700000F7c2C71CAaB6b250CA85237117FF702ebb).

The token trading will be limited for the first 10 minutes to holders of at least 20,000 X7DAO tokens.

The standard token transaction fee on all of these tokens is 2%.
Holders of >= 50,000 X7DAO tokens will only be charged a 1% fee.

40% of this fee will go back into the token liquidity of the X700 Series tokens.\
40% of this fee will be used to add liquidity to the X7m105/ETH liquidity pair.\
20% of this fee will be allocated manually within the ecosystem.

The first 10 minutes may be trading as usual.
Once the bots discover this network of pairs the charts may go wild.
If you do not understand what is going on, trade at your own risk.

The X700 series token liquidity will get additions from the Dex trading fees, so there will be a constantly rising floor.

Please enjoy riding on this rocket ship while it is being built!
