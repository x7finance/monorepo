gm or gn.

The X7D and X7 Lending Pool Reserve contracts have been deployed:

    X7D: 0x7D000a1B9439740692F8942A296E1810955F5000
    X7 Lending Pool Reserve: 0x7Ca54e9Aa3128bF15f764fa0f0f93e72b5267000

In the next few hours we will set the X7 Lending Pool Reserve as the destination for the Lending Pool on the X7 Ecosystem Splitter. The existing escrowed funds will flow in to the X7 Lending Pool Reserve contract. The website dashboard has been updated to include this contract for the purposes of calculating the total Lending Pool balance. We encourage any community tools to also update to reflect this contract in the Lending Pool balance.

All funds that flow from ecosystem contracts into the X7 Lending Pool Reserve will result in X7D being minted and sent to the X7 Token Time Lock.

This is controlled by calling the setEcosystemPayer function. The ecosystem contracts that have been configured as payers are below:

    X7100 Liquidity Hub:    0x7102407afa5d6581AAb694FEB03fEB0e7Cf69ebb\
    X7RLiquidity Hub:       0x712E87520f35a0a17A49bcCA4D87c201F0A46EBb\
    X7DAO Liquidity Hub:    0x7DA0e45cE7fD8359544Be00a6618215770851ebB\
    X7 Ecosystem Splitter:  0x70001BA1BA4d85739E7B6A7C646B8aba5ed6c888\
    X7 Treasury Splitter:   0x70006B785AA87821331a974C3d5af81CdE5BB999\
    X7 Ecosystem Maxi:      0x7000CAE2C1016e7De45ec9b54F1835b966BCA4f7\
    X7 Liquidity Maxi:      0x7000F8270B955377e047da8202aE3c408186B4F7\
    X7 DEX Maxi:            0x7000b3B5e4e126610A7b7d1Af2D2DE8685c7C4f7\
    X7 Borrowing Maxi:      0x7000D5d7707Bf86b317deC635e459E47b9aBD4F7\
    X7 Magister:            0x7dA0bb55E4097FC2d78a1822105057F36C5F360d

These transactions can be viewed by looking at the early functions called on the X7 Lending Pool Reserve contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ca54e9aa3128bf15f764fa0f0f93e72b5267000).

The time lock for ecosystem X7D tokens has been configured on the X7 Token Time lock for 2023-02-01. In the next few days if everything appears to be operating as expected, this will be extended to one year. This lock will be controlled by the DAO once governance handover occurs.

X7D is a fully backed token with the future opportunity to earn rewards based on the lending activity (and other possible revenue generating activity). Please take note of the caution givin in the X7 Lending Pool contract. However, with that caution noted, it is now possible for community members to participate in growing the lending pool balance through direct contributions by calling the depositETH or depositETHForRecipient functions on the X7D Lending Pool Reserve contract. X7D that has been minted may be withdrawn by calling the withdrawETH on the X7D Lending Pool Reserve contract. These capabilities will be added to app.x7.finance in the coming days but community members are encouraged (if they so choose at their own risk) to deposit ETH by using contract function write capabilities on a website like etherscan.io.

    depositETH: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ca54e9aa3128bf15f764fa0f0f93e72b5267000#writeContract#F1\
    depositETHForRecipient: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ca54e9aa3128bf15f764fa0f0f93e72b5267000#writeContract#F2\
    withdrawETH: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ca54e9aa3128bf15f764fa0f0f93e72b5267000#writeContract#F13

Contributors may also simply transfer ETH to the X7 Lending Pool Reserve contract and X7D will be minted to your wallet.

More contract deployments to come.

Long Live DeFi!
