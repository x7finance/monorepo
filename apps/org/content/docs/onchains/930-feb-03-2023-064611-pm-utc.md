gm or gn.

The rollout of the Ecosystem Contracts on BNB Smart Chain, Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum, and Optimism has begun.

We have created four Gnosis Multisignature wallets per chain.

These correspond to:

    1. X7 Operations\
    2. Community Operations\
    3. Discount Authority Committee\
    4. Fee To Receiver

Regarding (4) we will eventually collect DEX trading fees and liquidate them in a fully decentralized manner. However since the liquidity pairs which are created may present exotic liquidation paths and careful slippage calculations to ensure we fully capture the value of the fees, for now this will be done via a multisignature wallet and a collection of automated liqudiation methods that we can build up over time.

In order to deploy the X7 ecosystem more than 30 contracts need to be deployed from unique deployer addresses per chain. After being deployed many require careful initial configuration. We are moving through a very long checklist and will be double checking these deployments very carefully. Each contract should have the exact same address on all 5 chains. We expect this may take 1-2 days to fully complete, but do enjoy watching the on chain progress.

It is also concieveable that when we launch the token contracts it will result in an influx of Live Pair watchers from the given chain.

We invite you to educate them on what is being deployed and encourage you to remind them that ETH X7 token holders will be receiving airdrops for all chain tokens. These airdrop snapshots will occur just prior to the token launch.
