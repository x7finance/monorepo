# Xchange Router

Because routers are stateless and do not hold token balances, they can be replaced safely and trustlessly, if necessary. This may happen if more efficient smart contract patterns are discovered, or if additional functionality is desired. For this reason, routers have release numbers, starting at V1. This is currently recommended release, V2.

## Code

## State-Changing Functions

### addLiquidity

```solidity
function addLiquidity(
  address tokenA,
  address tokenB,
  uint amountADesired,
  uint amountBDesired,
  uint amountAMin,
  uint amountBMin,
  address to,
  uint deadline
) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB, uint liquidity);
```

Adds liquidity to an ERC-20⇄ERC-20 pool.

- To cover all possible scenarios, msg.sender should have already given the router an allowance of at least amountADesired/amountBDesired on tokenA/tokenB.
- Always adds assets at the ideal ratio, according to the price when the transaction is executed.
- If a pool for the passed tokens does not exists, one is created automatically, and exactly amountADesired/amountBDesired tokens are added.

  msg.value is treated as a amountETHDesired.
- Leftover ETH, if any, is returned to msg.sender.
